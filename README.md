RecipeCache is a simple recipe storage and reference app. It's built using a programmatic UI through UIKit, and uses CoreData for managing it's data.
With RecipeCache you can add a recipe containing an image, along with various, ingredients, prep steps, and cooking steps.
More advanced features include being able to add notes to specific ingredients, as well as a timer to specific cooking steps. 
A walkthrough feature allows you to cycle through your steps and ingredients, and includes an active timer for cooking steps. The UI for this
is inspired by Tinder's card system.

Settings within the app allow you to decide whether you'd like to organize your recipes alphabetically or by most recently created. Other settings include being
able to delay the start of a timer for a cooking step. The UI also supports dark mode, taking advantage of UIKit's systemBackground. 

An update is coming soon that will allow you to share recipes on social media and send them via iMessage.
